== mod_spox IRC bot ==

    mod_spox is an IRC robot, written in Ruby, and will completely
    change your prospective on life. mod_spox is proof that doing
    nothing is complex, and that doing nothing can, in fact, be
    doing something.
    
    The core of mod_spox is basically a framework for interacting
    with IRC. By itself, the bot does nothing of value, aside from
    sucking up bandwidth and resources from the server it is connected
    to. The core bot can connect to a server, format information from
    the server, and send information back to the server properly. That's
    pretty much it. 
    
    The framework that mod_spox provides is what allows it to quickly
    transition from an old sack of moldy potatoes to an old sack of
    moldy potatoes on fire. Luckly, mod_spox comes with a bunch of
    prepackaged plugins, so you too can have an IRC bot of your very
    own!
